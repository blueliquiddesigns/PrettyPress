PrettyPress is a WordPress plugin that simplifies and smartens the way you write online.
It rids distractions and bloated features, to give you exactly what you need to write posts quickly:


* A markdown editor and parser
* A real-time live preview of your post
* A distraction free environment

[PrettyPress Pro][http://pro.evasivesoftware.com] users also have shortcodes executed and previewed in real-time.

###Live preview window, as you type
PrettyPress provides you with a live "front-end" preview of the post you are writing. This means you can write your post remaining confident it will look as intended by the end.

###Write in markdown
PrettyPress ships out of the box as a markdown editor. All markdown is converted on the fly, giving you instant previews of your post, as you type.

##FAQ

###PrettyPress breaks the front end preview of my site, what should I do?
Check that your theme is correctly using the_title_attribute for title="" attributes. If your theme is incorrectly using the_title(), PrettyPress hooks will automatically be applied here, thus breaking your theme.

###My shortcodes don't execute in the preview window
Live shortcode previews are only available to [PrettyPress Pro][http://pro.evasivesoftware.com] users.
